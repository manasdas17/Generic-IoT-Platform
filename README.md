# Generic-IoT-Platform
Internet of Things (IoT) is the setup of all the physical devices that we can imagine in
our day to day life for collection and transmission of data through various sensors.
This makes life easy with minimal human intervention. This project aims at creating a
platform for data transmission and reception from various sensors and plotting the
graphs on a dashboard developed using javascript. It also includes the process to
setup a Smart plug in which a device can be plugged in and controlled using a
dashboard application after authentication. The data transmission is secured so that
no external user can see the information that is being exchanged between an
authenticated client and server.
The data exchange is done using MQTT protocol and ESP8266. ESP8266 is the WiFi
module which includes a microcontroller unit that can be programmed using Arduino
IDE. ESP8266 connects to the active WiFi connection and supports the data
transmission using MQTT. Various libraries have been included in the project and
corresponding links have been provided in this documentation.

The project is divided into two sections
● Hardware section:
Hardware section involves arranging the setup and making the circuits required for
the project. It also includes setting up the ESP8266 module and programming it using
Arduino IDE.
● Software section:
The Software section includes creating a Web Application for the user using NodeJs
and WebViewer in Android Studio. It provides many functionalities to the user like
adding a device, controlling it etc​.
● How to use 
Please refer to the documentation for how to use the applications.
